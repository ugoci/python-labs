# Write a function called `make_sandwich()` that sticks to the following:
# - takes a type of bread as its first, required argument
# - takes an arbitrary amount of toppings
# - returns a string representing a sandwich with the bread on top
#   and bottom, and the toppings in between.

from random import randint
import random

    toppings = print(f"{n} number of toppings")
    return print(f"{bread} bread untop with, {toppings}, and bread at the bottom")
